They will be able to solve Jeopardy problems far better

They will be able to fly a jet fighter far better

Because those are fundamental physics

Even Jeopardy those are fundamental physics at the level of information

But that's not what happens when we write poetry

That's not what happens when we make art

What we're doing when it works

is we're doing something quite unexpected

we're doing something

when it works, when something touches you it is in fact

it is meaningful because it's a thought that's has never been thought before

And that's not what computers are good at

They're good at simulating every possible thought based on every thought that has been thought

They're terrible at coming up with a new one because they're not processing the world we are

what computers are doing when they think doesn't look like thinking as we would understand it

it produces results that are the same results that come from thinking but that's not thinking
