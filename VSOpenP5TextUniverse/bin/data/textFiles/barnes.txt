The sky lowered in solace smaller than him, pale blue and stronger than me. We slept below a comforter that glistened like ice. I was awake, roar of the sea.

I was coming to terms with being even more distant asking the night for all varieties of home. I saw a gray blue graveyard, grave in the sky. I buried my face and collected my edges. He wrapped me up in his arms, a forest of firs to gather inside.

My valence was a place with trees his a void with no shine monstrous, simply obeyed by the wind aching for something elemental.

I knocked down stars with an icepick. I wanted to light up the way he thought he felt, even if it burned. He vaulted into a cosmic marsh his hair becoming white-hot matter. I saw something blink across the sky inside his mouth, flash of a word that would erase me.
