THINGS TO REMEMBER WHEN BUILDING CLOUDS

-- run Visual System Manager and generate a new copy_clouds_data src (CLOUDS/scripts/copy_clouds_data.sh)
	— run the script,
	- CloudsData is created under apps/
	- delete runs/
	- delete vhx/tokens
	- delete fml/
	- delete link/ backups

-- Run Permissions commands on data folder before building package


TO BUILD BINARIES
	— from Xcode, select CLOUDS target and select Product -> Archive. it will rebuild
	- archive window will pop up
	- Click Validate (validate for Developer ID-Signed)
	- Click Export (Export a developer signed application)

TO BUILD PACKAGES
	- open the package scripts


--- Use this codesigning command:
$ productsign --sign "Developer ID Installer: Serious Computational Cinema LLC (Z658858QS8)" CLOUDS.pkg _signed/INSTALL\ CLOUDS.pkg


-- Use copy & paste to put the icon on the signing package

-- Rename to hide the pkg file extension

-- If an install is crashing due to data folder issues, comment out the development build search for data path so it defaults to the installation files.

-- The writable directory permissions need to set explicitly to chmod 777
	- fml/
	- runs/
	- quality/
	- vhx/

VHX:
-- open the old disk image, delete the old installer, drag in the new installer, and empty the trash

-- Unmount the installer and in Disk Utility select Convert... > to create a compressed DMG for distribution

USB:
-- Create the image using dd
