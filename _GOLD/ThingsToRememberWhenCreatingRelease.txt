THINGS TO REMEMBER WHEN BUILDING CLOUDS

-- run Visual System Manager and generate a new copy_clouds_data src

-- Run Permissions commands on data folder before building package

--- Use this codesigning command:
$ productsign --sign "Developer ID Installer: Serious Computational Cinema LLC (Z658858QS8)" CLOUDS.pkg _signed/INSTALL\ CLOUDS.pkg

-- Use copy & paste to put the icon on the signing package

-- Rename to hide the pkg file extension

-- If an install is crashing due to data folder issues, comment out the development build search for data path so it defaults to the installation files.

-- The writable directory permissiones need to set explicitly to chmod 777
