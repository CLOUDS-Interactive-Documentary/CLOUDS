Words I think are closer to formulas They're closer to computer code

And I think the magical thing about words is that you can conjure up an infinity of things very easily with words 

In computer code you can create a loop that does a thousand things at once or a million or a billion

It's basically the same code

In a diagram how are you going to diagram a quadrillion things

You can't really do it
