This is a very good example of how you can use counting and numeric thinking to understand something that otherwise would be totally ethereal is that 

The english language is this sort of mysterious and cloudy object out there

And yet there's just so many words, a limited number. You can fit them al on the screen at once

And there's something there's a feeling of power you get when you see it

It's like "this is it" these are all the things we know how to talk about in a single word

And I think it also gives you respect for the power of language, for the power of syntax

We can say everything that we want in these few blocks
