Trying to see thought in any way is completely fascinating

I love looking at MRI scans even though I don't understand them

It's this idea that you have access to some idea about how we're actually thinking

and with computers you have access to certain things

and with simple algorithms there are beautiful visualizations of sorting algorithms that can help you understand them

I did a visualization about chess where you can see a computer thinking about chess

and it gives you some idea of just how many moves it's considering which is fun
