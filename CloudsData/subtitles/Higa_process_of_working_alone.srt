1
00:00:00.0 - 00:00:01.1
Yes.   

2
00:00:01.1 - 00:00:03.7
When I work on my own projects,   

3
00:00:03.7 - 00:00:09.1
there are no such restrictions

4
00:00:09.1 - 00:00:13.7
I may take a long time simply thinking about 'what should I try?'...   

5
00:00:13.7 - 00:00:22.0
I may keep adding bits and bits to what I wrote without much thought one day  

6
00:00:22.0 - 00:00:25.8
It's like a session for me...   

7
00:00:25.8 - 00:00:30.7
Something like..  I will check on the results produced by a program I've written 

8
00:00:30.7 - 00:00:35.1
then decide what to do next. It's a typical approach I take to my own projects.   

9
00:00:35.1 - 00:00:36.6
Yeah.  

10
00:00:36.6 - 00:00:37.2
