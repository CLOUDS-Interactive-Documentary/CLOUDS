1
20 --> 180
The dream I have for CLOUDS

2
210 --> 405
is that it's a cut, a longitudinal cut

3
406 --> 497
–you know those tubes that are extracted from Antártica

4
498 --> 658
 that have different layers of ice from different periods

5
659 --> 850
and allow you to measure what the properties of the air were at a certain moment of the earth's history

6
860 --> 1037
I think CLOUDS could be that, a sort of snapshot

7
1038 --> 1168
a longitudinal cut of what this historical period is like
