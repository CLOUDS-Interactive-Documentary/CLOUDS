1
0 --> 88
I was doing research for 'interactivos' 

2
88 --> 211
one of my first projects was called 'communitas', a circular multitouch table

3
220 --> 410
So I spent time watching videos of how people interacted with tactile surfaces

4
411 --> 601
and a recurring image was of people being drawn to the tactile table,

5
602 --> 676
and moving things around

6
677 --> 870
to try out the system with some confusion about how it works

7
871 --> 1016
and not really interacting with others.
