\f1 \cf0 Playlist\
\
There has to be a way I thought or a program that is a mix between a playlist and a flowchart\
\
Playlist 2\
\
So that I can somehow suggest a sequence of songs, and I when I find a sort of direction and I can take it, and otherwise the program can lead somewhere else\
\
for example if the group needs something more upbeat \
\
CopyPaste \
\
So basically it was copying and pasting different things that I saw on the internet. So i didn't have a deep understanding of programmin, \
\
Finding Dan Shiffman\
\
During that time, I stumbled upon Dan Shiffman's book\'85\
\
The orange one, learning processing. \
\
And then I realized there was a community combing art and ethnology. And I had always been interested in computers, and making art, and I thought, this is awesome!\
\
And istarted to read the book on my own. I devoured it. And the learning curve was fantastic. \

\
InteractiveTable 1\
\
I was doing research for "Interactivos", one of my first projects was called "communitas" it was a circular multitouch table.\
\
So I spent time watching videos of how people interacted with tactile surface. and a recurring image was of people being drawn to the tactile table, and moving things around, to try out the system with some (anxiety, confusion, uncertainty) about how it works\'85 and not really interacting with others.\
\
 \
InteractiveTable 2\
\
I thought it was interesting to work on balancing that. To create installations that invited people to collaborate, to relate to each other, and mainly reduce the anxiety that we feel around technology.\
\
 Play 1\
\
We all recognize immediately that play has huge potential. And we all recognize that through play we learn and that it is a mental state that we enjoy and in which our senses expand. We lose the dimension of time. Time accelerates. And also there's a lot of research that has been done about how play dissolves the boundaries between people. between self and other. within and without. the subjective and objective. Whatever is happening within bleeds into reality. SO a broom or a stick becomes a sword. A doll can be container of the projection of a lot of things. The relationship with my father or a situation that is hard for me. It could be a lot of things\
\
Play 2\
\
SO play offers this intermediate space between reality and fiction. \
\
Theory of Play 1\
\
The more hours of play a child has the healthier he will be. It's as if play were helping us develop white blood cells, natural antibodies, that strengthen our psychic and symbolic apparatus so we can better process issues in the future.\
\
Theory of Play 2\
\
As we grow, these experiences of play are reduced, or, rather change. I think in our community we have a huge advantage, of, we're very much in touch with play, and we're encouraged to keep playing and create play for others.\
\
Rethinking education systems \
\
The education system is entering process of rethinking itself. Actually Systems in general, with movements like open source and so on.\
\
Systems that were very stratified, top down, where someone has the knowledge imparts it in small drops: that paradigm is in crisis. And we all remember play as a kind of oasis of authentic collaboration, with a structure that is actually horizontal.\
\
\
Zeitgeist of open source\
\
There's a spirt that's been in the air, for the last 20 or 30 years, and it's getting stronger and we're now able to articulate with technology and through academic spaces, like the media lab.\

Seduced by play 1\
\
I think what seduced me was play.\
\
Seduced by play 2\
\
What draws me to new media is that it gives me a chance (reincorporate) (get play back) into my life, to go back to that space of play but from more of an adult perspective, and also incorporating more things that I like. \
\
\
Making Tools\
\
Because of my background, it's more natural for me to think of tools than to think of artistic projects\
\
Seduced by play 3\
\
For me all of this has a meaning if I achieve that state of play, of pleasure, of learning. And especially in the last few years, if it gives me the possibility to play with other people.\
\
\
\
Building Universes 1\
When I was a kid I played a lot by myself and created these huge imaginary universes. So I'm very attracted by the possibility to come back to these spaces of play, but inviting other people in. \
\
Building universes 2\
\
This thing we do building that live within computers, it's fascinating because it has a tangible quality. What is in your imagination appears on the screen and other person can join, add things, and respond. That's very interesting to me. \
\
Jam Session\
\
It's like a jam session, a kind of drum circle, but imaginary.\
\
New Media Space\

\
What I love about code\
\
Imaginative Technologies 1\
\
One of the fantastic things about code is the ability to, because you're in such an abstract environment, it's the most direct way to translate an idea from your imagination into a form that can be shared. \
\
It could be a simple processing sketch, or it could be an application,  that takes you longer to make in oF\
\
But in the end you have something tanbiel to show,\
\
Something that talks about a process or about an idea that starts to develop or come out of nowhere, an algorithm, a pattern that repeats, something that has motion. \
\
#GOLD \
\
Imaginative Technologies 2\
\
All of these properties that interactive applications tend to have, and applications in general, have expressive qualities that are sometimes very abstract and seem to come from the realm of the imagination.  \

Alchemy 1\
\
\strike \strikec0 Since Alchemy, all languages have this property of making things concr\strike0\striked0 ete. The privilege of our era is that we can see this process with some immediacy: from having an idea to embodying it in something. This idea from alchemy of having a set of symbols that speak of a metaphysical and spiritual process, that leads you somewhere with a lot of abstraction on the way and that ends up being an artistic, spiritual, religious discipline. In our times it becomes a reality. Especially now that we have 3D printers. so reality the step between complete abstraction- that is code- to something physical and real is so short. That's amazing. \
