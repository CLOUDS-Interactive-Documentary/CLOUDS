Somehow that spatial data makes it more personal,

3
00:00:05:17 --> 00:00:09:22
and even if we are all being recorded, I feel like there is some sort of

4
00:00:09:25 --> 00:00:14:01
connection with the other people who have been involved in this project like

5
00:00:15:10 --> 00:00:21:19
I don’t know it’s also knowing that that data is out there and like you could sort of touch any of those datasets.

00:00:21:22 --> 00:00:28:18
I can watch somebody else’s interview and know that I could also go in and like re-mix them and have access to their face

7
00:00:28:21 --> 00:00:33:07
and I could start playing with the geometry of their face and that’s such a

8
00:00:33:10 --> 00:00:36:24
personal thing, but it’s also totally out there for the taking, you know.
