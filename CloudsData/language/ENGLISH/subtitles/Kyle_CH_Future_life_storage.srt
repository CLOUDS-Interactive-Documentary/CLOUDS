1
00:00:01:03 --> 00:00:03:06
You would live your life and 

2
00:00:03:16 --> 00:00:07:08
accrue all of this data and all of these things that 

3
00:00:07:11 --> 00:00:11:01
altogether create a constellation of your personality

4
00:00:11:06 --> 00:00:15:11
 and then model that personality and put it into a computer that then

5
00:00:15:14 --> 00:00:17:20
 future generations could interact with.  

6
00:00:18:02 --> 00:00:21:14
Theoretically like by the time we are all dead, 

7
00:00:21:29 --> 00:00:25:17
people will have all this material and even this documentary 

8
00:00:25:20 --> 00:00:28:28
to look back on and they will see us speaking

9
00:00:29:01 --> 00:00:33:05
and maybe if the technology is advanced enough it will be generative where we can

10
00:00:33:08 --> 00:00:34:19
 project our personalities 

11
00:00:35:17 --> 00:00:40:20
and our own experiences into the future

12
00:00:40:23 --> 00:00:44:03
 and answer questions that we never would have thought of or 

13
00:00:44:06 --> 00:00:48:03
 encounter circumstances that never existed in our own time.

14
00:00:48:23 --> 00:00:52:19
Or our great, great, great grandchildren can download 

15
00:00:52:28 --> 00:00:56:06
 the archive of our life and peruse at will
