1
60 --> 197
My background in programming is nonexistent

2
198 --> 290
I don't have any academic knowledge about programming

3
291 --> 372
and everything I learned was by looking into other people's code

4
373 --> 487
So I have an intimate experience of reading someone else's code

5
488 --> 547
and spend time trying to understand how they think

6
548 --> 642
until at some point it makes sense

7
643 --> 904
there are many people in the world who have been my teachers

8
905 --> 1079
and who have taught me to think differently.
