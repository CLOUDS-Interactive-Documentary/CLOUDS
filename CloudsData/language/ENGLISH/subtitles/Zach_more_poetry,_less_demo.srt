00:00:00:00 --> 00:00:04:16
So, what I worry about is that 
that a lot of times we are making these projects, 

2
00:00:04:19 --> 00:00:08:23
and it feels like we are doing tech demos 

3
00:00:08:26 --> 00:00:14:01
like we are making projects and we are taking some piece of technology and it’s like a demo, right?  

4
00:00:14:04 --> 00:00:19:07
It’s a demo, it’s interesting, but it’s like a demonstration of what the technology can do, 

5
00:00:19:10 --> 00:00:23:16
and what I want, what I hope, what I wish for is 

6
00:00:23:19 --> 00:00:26:25
more poetry, less demo.
