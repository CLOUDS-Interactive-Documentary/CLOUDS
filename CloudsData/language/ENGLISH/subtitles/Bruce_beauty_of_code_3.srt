00:00:01:07 --> 00:00:07:08
…At the lowest levels it’s like a bunch bleeps moving around on a little race track. 

2
00:00:07:16 --> 00:00:11:25
It’s just ones and zeroes moving through a processor,

3
00:00:11:28 --> 00:00:14:20
and processors are really beautiful intricate objects. 

4
00:00:14:23 --> 00:00:18:00
 They are too small for the human eye to see, but they are gorgeous.

5
00:00:18:03 --> 00:00:20:21
I mean they are like urbanscapes 

6
00:00:20:24 --> 00:00:28:14
and they are sort of ones and zeroes.  I mean, the idea that these things are passing through these endless numbers of gates, 

7
00:00:28:26 --> 00:00:33:01
there’s something profound about that,  just this kinda

8
00:00:34:11 --> 00:00:39:05
elemental activity on the level 

9
00:00:39:16 --> 00:00:42:15
of the metal surface!

10
00:00:42:18 --> 00:00:47:06
 It’s like the microbial world. 

11
00:00:47:09 --> 00:00:50:16
It’s like the intricacy of something under a microscope,

12
00:00:50:19 --> 00:00:55:20
 and you look at and you think, oh, gosh, these are like small fuzzy things that really dwell within us. 

13
00:00:55:23 --> 00:00:58:02
 They are kind of pervasive, 

14
00:00:58:07 --> 00:01:02:28
and there is a kind of majesty to that really.
