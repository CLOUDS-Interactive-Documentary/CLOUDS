I think the biggest difference for me, using digital technologies in storytelling, is

3
00:00:07:07 --> 00:00:10:06
 kind of the disembodied thoughts, the

4
00:00:10:09 --> 00:00:14:24
 I am going to take this structural system and create something that lives outside of me,

5
00:00:14:27 --> 00:00:20:03
 and now this little brain or whatever you want to call it can be accessed by others,

6
00:00:20:06 --> 00:00:24:06
 and they can manipulate it, and they are no longer manipulating the thought that’s inside my head, 

7
00:00:24:09 --> 00:00:27:24
but they are manipulating this kind of creative structure, 

8
00:00:27:27 --> 00:00:33:14
and I think that’s really interesting that this entity that’s created can exist

9
00:00:33:24 --> 00:00:39:09
 and be accessible anywhere across the planet and be sliceable and diceable across a number of different dimensions

10
00:00:39:12 --> 00:00:46:09
 and be something that people can manipulate and mold

 and create with.
