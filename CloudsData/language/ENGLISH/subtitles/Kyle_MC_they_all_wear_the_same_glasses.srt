00:00:00:02 --> 00:00:04:17
That’s a good question.  I would say, oh, they wear the same glasses and 

3
00:00:06:14 --> 00:00:10:09
they all have the same manners of gesticulation,

4
00:00:11:07 --> 00:00:14:29
 that they are kind of like introverted.  I see a lot of people walking around

5
00:00:15:02 --> 00:00:18:13
 kind of like not sure if they should talk to someone or not. 

6
00:00:19:10 --> 00:00:22:15
 I don’t know.  I feel like

7
00:00:23:17 --> 00:00:26:23
 the first impression would be something about 

8
00:00:26:29 --> 00:00:29:09
peoples’ kind of habits and mannerisms, 

9
00:00:29:29 --> 00:00:32:12
but once you get beyond that and into conversation,

10
00:00:32:15 --> 00:00:35:14
you can start to see that everyone is kind of bound by 

11
00:00:35:19 --> 00:00:38:18
 this thread of digital media that connects all of us 

12
00:00:39:05 --> 00:00:43:12
and we are all really deeply engaged with each other 

13
00:00:43:21 --> 00:00:47:15
when we are not in Minneapolis using social media, using the internet.
