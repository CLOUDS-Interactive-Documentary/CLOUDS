00:00:01:14 --> 00:00:06:08
I liked how open-ended it was and how everyone was just sort of

2
00:00:06:11 --> 00:00:10:18
searching for a project to work on together, and

3
00:00:11:12 --> 00:00:16:15
I don’t know, it was so great to walk around and see what everyone is doing, kind of glance over their computer screens

4
00:00:16:18 --> 00:00:22:10
and every time someone had a breakthrough, we all got up and ran over their computer screen and watched their demo

5
00:00:22:13 --> 00:00:27:17
and that was really great and I can’t even think of like another experience that I have had like that

6
00:00:27:20 --> 00:00:31:24
just like everyone was in peak creative mood for days at a time

7
00:00:31:27 --> 00:00:35:20
and that everything is open and sharing with one another.
