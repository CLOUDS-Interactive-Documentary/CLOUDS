2
00:00:00:26 --> 00:00:04:12
The whole idea comes from a lot of the quite 

3
00:00:04:15 --> 00:00:09:05
disturbing events that have happened in the last two maybe three years, 

4
00:00:09:08 --> 00:00:13:07
so the Arab Spring happening, all the protests in the Euro Zone, 

5
00:00:13:10 --> 00:00:15:26
Fukushima, and the financial crisis. 

6
00:00:15:29 --> 00:00:21:08
It feels like a lot of the things in the world are in turmoil and changing 

7
00:00:21:11 --> 00:00:25:25
on the level of a paradigm shift really, 

8
00:00:25:28 --> 00:00:30:06
and even though they seem completely unrelated 

9
00:00:30:09 --> 00:00:32:23
and from completely different areas of our lives, 

10
00:00:32:26 --> 00:00:35:22
it feels like there might be connections between them, 

11
00:00:35:27 --> 00:00:39:04
and that’s why we called this project Energy Flow, 

12
00:00:39:07 --> 00:00:43:10
because we want to look at this kind of underlying streams of energy (that) are 

13
00:00:43:13 --> 00:00:45:03
happening in social situations 

14
00:00:45:06 --> 00:00:48:03
and in physical processes and in biological processes 

15
00:00:48:06 --> 00:00:53:06
and maybe even in the one or two spiritual situations 

16
00:00:53:09 --> 00:00:56:19
and just see 

17
00:00:56:22 --> 00:00:58:08
how they might be connected.
