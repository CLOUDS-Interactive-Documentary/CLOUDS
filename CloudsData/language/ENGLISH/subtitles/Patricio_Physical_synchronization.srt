1
24 --> 212
With distances, it's very difficult to feel the other.

2
213 --> 350
Especially if you have a long distance relationship

3
351 --> 491
One has an abstract idea of the other person, and how they are, their mood

4
492 --> 639
and this generates a strange situation in which one is on a frequency of her own

5
640 --> 775
and something happens â€“something happens, something real and very strong

6
776 --> 855
and with respect to physicality, to the individual organism

7
856 --> 947 
when one meets the other person

8 
948 --> 1150
If you touch them, you get instantly synchronized

9
1151 --> 1245
and that's super powerful.
