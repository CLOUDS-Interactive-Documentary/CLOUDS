00:00:01.2 - 00:00:05.1 
I prefer a very simple drawing style in general

00:00:05.1 - 00:00:09.9
Commercial software tends to omit the 
simple functions I like

00:00:09.9 - 00:00:21.1
And it's often quicker to make it myself

00:00:21.1 - 00:00:24.6
As said before, I much prefer this 
simple approach to drawing.  

00:00:24.6 - 00:00:29.7 
So, it's faster to use code
