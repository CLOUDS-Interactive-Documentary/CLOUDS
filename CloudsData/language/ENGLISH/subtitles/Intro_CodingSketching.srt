00:00:00:00 --> 00:00:04:00
Well	 what I want to do… 
I want to program like I can paint

2
00:00:04:00 --> 00:00:07:00
So ten years ago I painted a lot

3
00:00:07:00 --> 00:00:10:00
and I want to get the same feeling with code


4
00:00:10:00 --> 00:00:13:00
I sort of had a problem that I couldn’t draw

5
00:00:13:00 --> 00:00:17:00
and I couldn’t sculpt	 and 
I couldn’t basically do anything

6
00:00:17:00 --> 00:00:21:00
I ended up going into using coding for that


7
00:00:21:00 --> 00:00:24:00
engaging people with art that was more technical

8
00:00:24:00 --> 00:00:27:00
and creating this way for people who 
were not technical to code as well

9
00:00:27:00 --> 00:00:30:00
so this idea that we have really promoted 
with processing: sketching with code

10
00:00:30:00 --> 00:00:34:00
that you think through doing and you learn and 
you develop through making
