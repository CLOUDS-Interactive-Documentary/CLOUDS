00:00:00:28 --> 00:00:05:21
And it wasn’t until I started working as a professional doing webwork and started —

3
00:00:05:26 --> 00:00:12:27
at that time my passion was doing print design, designing book kind of work and magazine kind of work—

4
00:00:13:00 --> 00:00:18:11
and I always thought it as designing systems, so I was thinking about parameters and I was thinking about time,

5
00:00:18:14 --> 00:00:23:20
but just on a different scale, and as I started working in the web, I started seeing

6
00:00:23:25 --> 00:00:28:18
the potential for doing things that are more dynamic and more time-based and more flexible,

7
00:00:28:21 --> 00:00:33:23
and it was really through seeing the work of John Maeda that made this connection for me.
