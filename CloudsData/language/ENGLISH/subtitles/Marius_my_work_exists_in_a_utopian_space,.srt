The reality that I deal with is one of a utopian space of form.

2
00:00:05:09 --> 00:00:10:16
Basically, if you ask me what is your work about, what do these structures mean,

3
00:00:10:19 --> 00:00:13:04
ultimately they don’t refer to anything outside themselves.

4
00:00:13:07 --> 00:00:17:08
So, the only reality that they inhabit is their own reality, it’s their own space.

5
00:00:17:11 --> 00:00:22:24
I could wax lyrical about sort of an imaginary alternate universe,

6
00:00:22:27 --> 00:00:24:06
but that’s not really how I see it.

7
00:00:24:09 --> 00:00:27:21
I see each form that I create as inhabiting its own space 

8
00:00:27:24 --> 00:00:32:12
and I'm trying to explore what that space sort of implies for the form.
