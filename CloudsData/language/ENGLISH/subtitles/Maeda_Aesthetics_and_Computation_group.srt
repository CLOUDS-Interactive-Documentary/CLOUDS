2
00:00:01:03 --> 00:00:03:28
And these students knew no pain levels

3
00:00:04:01 --> 00:00:07:04
 and they were excited to use computation for expression, 

4
00:00:07:18 --> 00:00:11:00
and we would see new kinds of work, whether it’s semantic processing, 

5
00:00:11:03 --> 00:00:15:12
using graphics or interactivity in a weird direction,

6
00:00:15:20 --> 00:00:19:11
and it was amazing because it was still new 

7
00:00:19:22 --> 00:00:22:29
using computation to express the human experience

8
00:00:23:28 --> 00:00:27:18
 and that led to Aesthetics and Computation as our group name

9
00:00:27:21 --> 00:00:30:27
 and began to look for people who were hybrids,

10
00:00:31:00 --> 00:00:36:19
 who were coder-artists, artist-coders and began to pull them together into one space at MIT.
