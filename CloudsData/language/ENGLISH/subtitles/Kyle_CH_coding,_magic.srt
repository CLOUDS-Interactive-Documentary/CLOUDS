00:00:00:29 --> 00:00:02:27
We live 

3
00:00:03:04 --> 00:00:06:02
in a world that’s a hybrid between physical and digital 

4
00:00:06:05 --> 00:00:08:29
and programming is a way to alter the digital world 

5
00:00:09:09 --> 00:00:11:17
on like an atomic scale, 

6
00:00:11:24 --> 00:00:16:14
so by writing these programs and by creating art that uses code, 

7
00:00:16:22 --> 00:00:20:06
you are literally altering the reality that we live in

8
00:00:20:14 --> 00:00:23:27
 and taking that world and twisting it to your own ends, 

9
00:00:24:00 --> 00:00:28:09
and I think that’s something that not that many people can do yet, and so 

10
00:00:28:12 --> 00:00:33:01
for someone who doesn’t code and for viewers of the stuff, it’s 

11
00:00:33:07 --> 00:00:35:25
nothing but magic.  It’s 

12
00:00:36:06 --> 00:00:40:14
phenomenal.  It just looks like the world is changing before your eyes.
