1
00:00:00.0 - 00:00:01.6 
and well...

2
00:00:01.6 - 00:00:12.4
I'm not sure if I'd say 'collaboration'... but in general, 
I love working with things that cannot be controlled.  

3
00:00:12.4 - 00:00:19.1 
For example, a program can be slightly changed 
by entering a different number... but 

4
00:00:19.1 - 00:00:24.4
If I change the number radically, not by mistake, what happens?  

5
00:00:24.4 - 00:00:34.5
So, I'd get the result. And then, I'd evaluate 
whether it's a 'good' one or 'bad' one.   

6
00:00:34.5 - 00:00:40.2
And, I may decide whether to keep it or not
