2
00:00:00:20 --> 00:00:05:02
Right, because it’s current, it’s what we see everyday

3
00:00:05:05 --> 00:00:09:06
like anybody, anyone on the street has their cell phone 

4
00:00:09:09 --> 00:00:13:02
and they go out to see like the screens in front of the subway station. 

5
00:00:13:05 --> 00:00:16:13
I don’t know, they get an hourly weather report.

6
00:00:16:16 --> 00:00:20:13
If they check the internet, it’s just like how you get your information,

7
00:00:20:16 --> 00:00:25:29
 it’s how you get your media, and so it’s like how you are used to seeing the world,

8
00:00:26:07 --> 00:00:29:18
and you know I feel like to talk about 

9
00:00:29:21 --> 00:00:33:04
our experience in any other way is just not relevant.

10
00:00:33:07 --> 00:00:37:13
It’s so abstract and unrelatable.

11
00:00:37:16 --> 00:00:41:03
You kind of have to if you want to engage the everyday.
