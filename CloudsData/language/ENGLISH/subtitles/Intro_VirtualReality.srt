00:00:00:00 --> 00:00:05:00
You know the question is, so where
does reality reside? I mean

2
00:00:05:00 --> 00:00:11:00
we’re already many dollars short understanding the
reality immediately around us

3
00:00:11:00 --> 00:00:20:00
I think it’s really possible to reach a perspective
where you still see yourself in your world 

4
00:00:20:00 --> 00:00:24:00
but you also see a slightly larger context
and see more possibilities to the way things can be

5
00:00:24:00 --> 00:00:26:00
and the way that you can be and exist

6
00:00:26:00 --> 00:00:32:00
and if you can hack reality as it were,
that’s a very interesting thing
