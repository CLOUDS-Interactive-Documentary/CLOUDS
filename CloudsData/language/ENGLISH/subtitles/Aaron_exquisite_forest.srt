2
00:00:00:16 --> 00:00:05:10
So, we thought, well, what would happen if we allow them to guide the actual trajectory of the storyline,

3
00:00:05:13 --> 00:00:09:22
 what would happen if we empowered them to create their own stories

4
00:00:09:25 --> 00:00:13:06
 and allow people to branch the stories in different directions. 

5
00:00:13:09 --> 00:00:17:14
 What we landed on was basically creating these seeds, these

6
00:00:17:17 --> 00:00:20:24
kind of ideas for what a tree could be

7
00:00:20:27 --> 00:00:26:01
 and a number of Tate Modern artists, Olafur Eliasson, Julian Opie, and a number of others

8
00:00:26:04 --> 00:00:28:28
 created some seedlings that then people can branch off of.  

9
00:00:29:01 --> 00:00:32:14
They can create their own little animations that build off of other animations

10
00:00:32:17 --> 00:00:37:02
 and end up creating these trees of totally different narrative paths and trajectories.
