00:00:01:03 --> 00:00:03:00
So I took

2
00:00:03:05 --> 00:00:06:15
a class called -100 which is java programming 

3
00:00:06:20 --> 00:00:10:07
and one of the reasons I also took the classes was they give you a free laptop to use,

4
00:00:10:10 --> 00:00:14:15
 and I was like extra laptop, great, but

5
00:00:14:18 --> 00:00:18:20
I sort of enjoyed it and also one of my friends got a job working in John Maeda’s lab 

6
00:00:18:23 --> 00:00:20:20
 as an undergraduate research assistant, 

7
00:00:20:23 --> 00:00:23:07
and seemed like she was doing really fun stuff, 

8
00:00:23:10 --> 00:00:26:24
so I decided that I would like to do that too.
