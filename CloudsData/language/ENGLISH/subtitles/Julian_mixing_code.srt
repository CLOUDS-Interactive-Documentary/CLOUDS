1
00:00:00:04 --> 00:00:04:00
But the ability to actually mix code,

2
00:00:04:04 --> 00:00:06:07
and I don’t think people talk about that enough actually,

3
00:00:06:10 --> 00:00:09:22
but take a bit of that and a bit of that and a bit of that and get something going

4
00:00:09:25 --> 00:00:11:27
is in time with the way I work,

5
00:00:12:00 --> 00:00:14:25
and if I had to spend time

6
00:00:15:03 --> 00:00:19:24
just in a single closed-sourced context

7
00:00:19:27 --> 00:00:22:23
where I was needing to ask for –

8
00:00:23:01 --> 00:00:27:10
I actually can’t even imagine working that way.
