00:00:00:21 --> 00:00:05:07
The art that I do I really want it to be like have nothing to do with technology, 

3
00:00:05:10 --> 00:00:09:21
like I would love people to look at the things and say like oh, that’s a beautiful idea, 

4
00:00:09:24 --> 00:00:13:29
that’s a beautiful expression, that’s poetic, that’s meaningful, that’s resonant, 

5
00:00:14:02 --> 00:00:16:13
that tells me about what it’s like to be alive, that tells me about

6
00:00:16:16 --> 00:00:20:17
what it means to be human, and 

7
00:00:20:25 --> 00:00:22:21
not that’s a great piece of software, 

8
00:00:22:24 --> 00:00:27:21
not that’s a dope algorithm, but really like beyond that,

9
00:00:27:24 --> 00:00:32:22
so for me the act of programming is not important but the result it.
