1
00:00:00:28 --> 00:00:06:16
The most interest thing would be if you would combine that with a data visualization approach

2
00:00:06:29 --> 00:00:10:04
 in the context of that, 

3
00:00:10:26 --> 00:00:13:22
all the actors within that space and within - 

4
00:00:13:25 --> 00:00:17:27
not just the space or within that performance or whatever you want to call it-

5
00:00:18:00 --> 00:00:23:02
 is not static, but could maybe be chosen by the viewer, 

6
00:00:23:05 --> 00:00:27:10
 so you can have, for instance, a conversation about certain topics, 

7
00:00:27:13 --> 00:00:32:07
and because every in a way interview snippets

8
00:00:32:10 --> 00:00:36:15
 has metadata associated, you can in a way create infinite

9
00:00:36:18 --> 00:00:40:19
 conversations even if you have a finite amount of material.

10
00:00:40:29 --> 00:00:43:28
 I mean, nearly infinite. Obviously if 

11
00:00:44:04 --> 00:00:48:06
you have a finite source, you always get a finite outcome, but

12
00:00:50:10 --> 00:00:52:20
 yeah I mean that could be interesting, I don’t know.
