When I first started writing with code, I was making things that were very architectural

3
00:00:04:29 --> 00:00:10:05
and so every single element on the screen was put there because I wrote a line of code to do it,

4
00:00:10:08 --> 00:00:16:10
and then there was a time where I have been fascinated with artificial life and artificial intelligence for many years,

5
00:00:16:13 --> 00:00:20:17
and I have been reading sort of semi-professionally in those areas,

6
00:00:20:20 --> 00:00:25:07
and I started writing codes that’s built on emergence where you have a few simple rules

7
00:00:25:10 --> 00:00:30:02
and then the form builds as a result of these rules sort of acting themselves out.

8
00:00:30:05 --> 00:00:36:12
So I got really interested in general systems theory and cybernetics and started to try and bring those ideas into the software that I was writing.
