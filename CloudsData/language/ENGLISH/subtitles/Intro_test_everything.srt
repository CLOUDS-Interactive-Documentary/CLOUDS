Reality will only get you so far.

3
00:00:03:00 --> 00:00:07:00
Often you have to use tricks to make things seem more real 


4
00:00:07:00 --> 00:00:11:00
and these tricks are absolutely not based in reality

00:00:00:00 --> 00:00:04:00
Well	 what I want to do… I want to program like I can paint

7
00:00:04:00 --> 00:00:07:00
So ten years ago I painted a lot

8
0:0:07:00 --> 00:00:10:00
and I want to get the same feeling with code


9
0:0:10:00 --> 00:00:13:00
I sort of had a problem that I couldn’t draw

10
0:0:13:00 --> 00:00:17

and I couldn’t sculpt	 and I couldn’t basically do anything


11
0:0:17:00 --> 00:00:21:00
I ended up going into using coding for that


12
0:0:21:00 --> 00:00:24:00
engaging people with art that was more technical


13
0:0:24:00 --> 00:00:27:00
and creating this way for people who were not technical to code as well


14
0:0:27:00 --> 3.47222222222222E-04
so this idea that we have really promoted with processing: sketching with code


15
0:0:30:00 --> 00:00:34:00
that you think through doing and you learn and you develop through making
