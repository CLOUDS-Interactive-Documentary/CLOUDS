00:00:00:00 --> 00:00:04:11
If you are looking for a kind of logical extreme of what you are doing here,

2
00:00:04:14 --> 00:00:10:05
I mean given that I can like move my hands around and sort of like claw my way through these grids and particle clouds,

3
00:00:10:08 --> 00:00:12:24
why doesn’t that have some physical consequence?  

4
00:00:12:27 --> 00:00:16:10
Why can’t I just like get my granddaughter’s pictures, you know?

5
00:00:16:18 --> 00:00:19:22
Or call the cab, right?

6
00:00:19:25 --> 00:00:23:02
Or even just have my liver scanned?

7
00:00:23:05 --> 00:00:27:11
It’s like look inside me now.  How’d you do that?  Well, you know, just go ahead,

8
00:00:27:27 --> 00:00:31:24
 pull out the intra-violet, the ultrasound or whatever,

9
00:00:32:02 --> 00:00:36:00
bring it down to whatever scale you need to do, big, low.
