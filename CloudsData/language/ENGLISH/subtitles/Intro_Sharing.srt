00:00:00:00 --> 00:00:06:00
In general everyone in this community
is used to sharing in some way

2
00:00:06:00 --> 00:00:13:00
I think the nature of this work because it is so
technically complex, it has to be collaborative

3
00:00:13:00 --> 00:00:18:00
when processing first started there was a really
active community on the discussion boards

4
00:00:18:00 --> 00:00:21:00
and people were really contributing back and
forth and really supporting each other

5
00:00:21:00 --> 00:00:23:00
and people were really chipping in and explaining things

6
00:00:23:00 --> 00:00:31:00
for me it’s more about community and less about
the code or about the framework itself

7
00:00:31:00 --> 00:00:34:00
it’s the community around it which is really powerful

8
00:00:34:00 --> 00:00:37:00
cause without it I wouldn’t be here for example
