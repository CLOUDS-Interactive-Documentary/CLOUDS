One of the things that is so captivating about visualizing complex data

3
00:00:06:22 --> 00:00:13:23
is that sight is the sense for which we have the highest bandwidth,

4
00:00:13:26 --> 00:00:17:05
which means that we can take so much information just by looking at it.

5
00:00:17:08 --> 00:00:21:28
We are very good at – forget data, just looking at the world —

6
00:00:22:01 --> 00:00:24:20
we are very good at understanding complex patterns. 

7
00:00:24:23 --> 00:00:28:29
We are very good at looking at something very focusedly

8
00:00:29:02 --> 00:00:33:15
and then realizing that things are moving around you in the periphery.  We are good at that.
