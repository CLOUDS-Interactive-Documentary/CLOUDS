2
00:00:00:00 --> 00:00:03:17
Yeah, it’s a little bit intangible in a way.  I mean, I think

3
00:00:03:20 --> 00:00:06:06
 people say, oh, I'm a visual thinker or I'm a designer, I'm an artist, I do visual things so

4
00:00:06:09 --> 00:00:10:09
 it makes sense for me to learn code that way,

5
00:00:10:12 --> 00:00:13:23
 that’s not really I think for me what happened.  I don’t know exactly what happened, because

6
00:00:13:26 --> 00:00:18:02
 I don’t think of myself as a visual designer.

7
00:00:18:10 --> 00:00:22:23
 I don’t think of myself as particularly　visually talented.  I think most of the things

8
00:00:22:26 --> 00:00:26:08
if you ask me to draw or design something, it would

come out rather ugly, 

9
00:00:26:11 --> 00:00:30:01
but I do think that, the

10
00:00:30:11 --> 00:00:36:06
the, the, sort of the realization, there’s like a certain realization that happens

11
00:00:36:11 --> 00:00:40:12
 when you start to write your own software and you start to manipulate pixels, you 

12
00:00:40:15 --> 00:00:45:29
know this mysterious computer that you buy and you unpack and you put it on your desk and

13
00:00:46:02 --> 00:00:48:09
  it’s loaded with all this software and you use it to use all the stuff,

14
00:00:48:12 --> 00:00:52:29
 the moment that you realize that

it’s not magic, it’s not - 

15
00:00:53:03 --> 00:00:56:29
 you could just write all that software yourself, you can manipulate the pixels, you can draw,

16
00:00:57:02 --> 00:01:01:15
 you don’t need Photoshop. Photoshop is a wonderful piece of software for many reasons, 

17
00:01:01:18 --> 00:01:07:11
but I think for me that the visual nature of programming and drawing graphics, 

18
00:01:07:14 --> 00:01:12:01
it just opened up a world of possibilities that maybe didn’t exist….
