30 --> 247
CLOUDS has a property related to having a lot of interconnected information

2
248 --> 402
in a structure like a crystal

3
403 --> 515
that one can watch and enter from different angles

4
516 --> 607
and each time will be different because associations will be different

4
608 --> 761
and because the moment when you're in will give you different ideas

762 --> 890
If I had to put this in more metaphoric and romantic terms

891 --> 1005
I would say that clouds is made of principles that are very similar to dreams.
