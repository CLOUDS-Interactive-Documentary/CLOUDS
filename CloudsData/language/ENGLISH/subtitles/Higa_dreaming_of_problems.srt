Once when I was struggling with a challenging problem, 
it came up in a dream.  

3
00:00:07.9 - 00:00:14.9
It was a geometry problem I think

4
00:00:14.9 - 00:00:22.1 
I had been brainstorming, like, this, this 
and this would become this.

And that and that would go with this, 
and so on, until falling asleep

00:00:22.1 - 00:00:29.1
Then, I would go like... "wow! I got it!" and jump out of my bed. 
However, I quickly realized it still didn't work...

00:00:29.1 - 00:00:33.9
But later, one day, I managed to figure it out. Yeah...
