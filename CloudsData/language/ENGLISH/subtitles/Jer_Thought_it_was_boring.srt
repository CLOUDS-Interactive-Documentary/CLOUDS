2
00:00:01:02 --> 00:00:03:19
But I kind of thought it was boring, right.  I was like whatever,

3
00:00:03:22 --> 00:00:08:29
and it wasn’t until we had Open Paths running and when you go to Open Paths you can kind of see your life on this map

4
00:00:09:15 --> 00:00:14:13
I was really, really surprised at how profound that data was because

5
00:00:14:17 --> 00:00:18:22
I was really, really surprised at how profound that data was because

it was like going through a photo album

6
00:00:18:27 --> 00:00:24:25
and in some ways richer than going through a photo album because you had to imagine things.  It was like reading a

7
00:00:25:08 --> 00:00:29:04
a diary more than going through a photo album and

8
00:00:29:15 --> 00:00:35:10
I realized at that point that actually this data is something different

than I thought it was, because I thought the same thing everybody did I think which is well, it’s just tracking my location,

well, it’s just tracking my location,

9
00:00:35:13 --> 00:00:40:14
than I thought it was, because I thought the same thing everybody did I think which is well, it’s just tracking my location,

well, it’s just tracking my location,

10
00:00:40:17 --> 00:00:43:04
it’s just a set of numbers, it’s latitude and longitude, it’s boring.

11
00:00:43:12 --> 00:00:46:03
But then you realize that this data is

12
00:00:46:15 --> 00:00:49:13
 more than almost anything I can think about

13
00:00:49:16 --> 00:00:51:24
is it’s like a trace of your life, and I don’t know how many things are more important than that

14
00:00:51:27 --> 00:00:55:04
is it’s like a trace of your life, and I don’t know how many things are more important than that

15
00:00:55:08 --> 00:00:59:03
to have a thread and a record of

16
00:00:59:06 --> 00:01:03:14
of your life and where you have been and what you have done and who you’ve met 

where you have been and what you have done and who you’ve met 

17
00:01:03:17 --> 00:01:06:01
and who you’ve loved and so on and so on.
