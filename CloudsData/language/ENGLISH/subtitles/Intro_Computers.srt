00:00:00:00 --> 00:00:05:00
computers are bicycles for the mind, you know just a human on its own is just a human

2
00:00:05:00 --> 00:00:10:00
but with the addition of a bicycle we become the most efficient biped out there.

3
00:00:10:00 --> 00:00:16:00
and the computer holds the same thing in terms of the possibilities of what we can do with our creativity

4
00:00:16:00 --> 00:00:20:00
I think you can equate building a tool and building a language

5
00:00:20:00 --> 00:00:33:00
you’re creating a vocabulary, a set of possibilities, then offering that for others to use, interpret and explore

00:00:33:00 --> 00:00:36:00
Edsger Dijkstra in his Turing acceptance lecture said that

7
00:00:36:00 --> 00:00:42:00
programming has allowed humans to think thoughts previously unthinkable

8
00:00:42:00 --> 00:00:46:00
that’s why I’ve always been so interested in computers and technology

9
00:00:46:00 --> 00:00:50:00
is the possibility to go further than my own biological limit

10
00:00:50:00 --> 00:00:53:00
and share those kinds of things with other people as well
