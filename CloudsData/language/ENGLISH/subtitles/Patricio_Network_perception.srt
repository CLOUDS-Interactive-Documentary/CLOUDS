1
24 --> 220
When ICQ appeared, and the first chat applications

2
250 --> 354
â€“one of the first ideas I had is related to networks

3
355 --> 460
with this idea of being completely conscious that there's a much larger world

4
461 --> 593
that there are many things happening at the same time;

5
594 --> 722
before we had a perception of our own reality as separate compartments

5
723 --> 900
 not knowing what's happening elsewhere,

6
901 --> 1070
and being able to talk in real time with people at different parts of the world

7 
1100 --> 1300
made me realize that the world is more complex than I perceived before.
