1
24 --> 110
the first thing that comes to mind has to do with math

2
111 --> 202 
I have the sensation that I've never really understood Math and that

3
203 --> 471
once again, through Shiffman and learning to create 3d structures and things like that

4
472 --> 652
I had a sort of revelation â€“ a fantastic moment in which

5
653 --> 798
I started to see that Math is this abstract thing that is behind everything

6
799 --> 885
That is really no new knowledge, but it was new to me. 

7
886 --> 998
As if I'd... I'd discovered the bolts of the world

8
999 --> 1124
â€“I mean, that the world is constructed 

9
1125 --> 1349
and has knobs that adjust variables and connect and form structures

10
1350 --> 1402
the world in which we live

11
1403 --> 1505
This isn't a revolutionary idea coming from new technology

12
1506 --> 1668
but a perception that I, personally, have realized through code.
