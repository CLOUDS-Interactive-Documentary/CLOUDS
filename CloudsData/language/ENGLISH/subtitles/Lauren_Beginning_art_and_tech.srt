00:00:00:27 --> 00:00:04:28
So my entry into creative coding was kind of coming out of from a more traditional 

3
00:00:05:28 --> 00:00:09:27
computer science background and then also 

4
00:00:10:06 --> 00:00:12:19
an art background and then meeting in the middle 

5
00:00:12:25 --> 00:00:15:13
and seeing the potential there

6
00:00:15:16 --> 00:00:17:16
and also seeing the use of 

7
00:00:18:08 --> 00:00:21:17
creating languages specifically for this intersection
