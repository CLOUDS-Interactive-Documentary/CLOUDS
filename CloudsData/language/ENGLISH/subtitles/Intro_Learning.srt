00:00:00:00 --> 00:00:07:00
My goal is to learn all things about data visualization
and interactive visuals

2
00:00:07:00 --> 00:00:10:00
so I really need to know the technical stuff first

3
00:00:10:00 --> 00:00:15:00
yeah programming is a super power!
it’s great, you can do so many things with it

4
00:00:15:00 --> 00:00:17:00
you know it’s a little bit intangible in a way, I think

5
00:00:17:00 --> 00:00:23:00
there’s a certain realization that happens when you 
start to write your own software and manipulate pixels

6
00:00:23:00 --> 00:00:30:00
it just opened up a world of possibilities that I could 
just sit and tweak the numbers forever

7
00:00:30:00 --> 00:00:32:00
to just watch slightly different things happen
