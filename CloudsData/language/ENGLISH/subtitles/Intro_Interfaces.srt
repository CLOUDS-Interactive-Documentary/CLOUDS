1
00:00:00:00 --> 00:00:03:00
I wouldn’t put a line between real and virtual

2
00:00:03:00 --> 00:00:05:00
I think that it’s all real or unreal

3
00:00:05:00 --> 00:00:11:00
whether it’s physical or virtual would be more of a line for me

4
00:00:11:00 --> 00:00:17:00
and I think that’s quickly dissolving as we’re carrying technology
around with us all the time and using it constantly

5
00:00:17:00 --> 00:00:25:00
this question of what is reality is shifting as 
we delegate the questions around it to data

6
00:00:25:00 --> 00:00:30:00
you go around the world and things happen to you
that couldn’t happen before 

7
00:00:30:00 --> 00:00:35:00
you might be looking over here and this thing might
pop up with a readout from something

8
00:00:35:00 --> 00:00:39:00
and it will be perfectly rectified to the way you’re looking at it but someone
over there won’t be able to see it at all

9
00:00:39:00 --> 00:00:45:00
it will just be your environment is having this light cast onto it because it’s being scanned and projected onto
