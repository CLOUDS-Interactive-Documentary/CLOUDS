00:00:01:06 --> 00:00:05:10
And that’s how I learned how to program was, I addicted myself,

2
00:00:06:00 --> 00:00:09:19
and I’m highly addicted to programming.  

3
00:00:09:22 --> 00:00:13:14
You can’t stop me.  Sometimes I forget to eat.  Sometimes I forget to sleep, 

4
00:00:13:27 --> 00:00:15:01
and 

5
00:00:17:10 --> 00:00:21:22
 I don’t know, can you turn a pickle back into a cucumber?  Probably not.  

6
00:00:21:25 --> 00:00:25:19
So I'm here for life.  You’ve got me.  It’s terminal, terminal disease
