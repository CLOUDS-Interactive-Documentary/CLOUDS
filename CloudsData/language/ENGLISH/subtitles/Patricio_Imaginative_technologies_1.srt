2
142 --> 197
 because you're in such an abstract environment

198 --> 399
it's the most direct way to translate an idea from your imagination

4 
400 --> 545
into a form that can be shared

5
546 --> 737 
It could be a simple processing sketch

738 --> 814
or an application that takes you longer to make in openFrameworks

7
815 --> 945
But in the end you have something tangible to show

8
946 --> 1055
Something that talks about a process or about an idea 

9
1056 --> 1151

10
1152 --> 1248
that repeats, something that has motion
