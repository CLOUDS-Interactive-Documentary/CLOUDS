00:00:00:29 --> 00:00:04:06
One of the fantastic things about code



3
00:00:04:13 --> 00:00:08:10
 is the ability toã€€because you're in such an abstract environment

4
00:00:08:14 --> 00:00:13:10
it's the most direct way

5
00:00:13:13 --> 00:00:16:14
to translate an idea

6
00:00:16:17 --> 00:00:17:27
(qual lo que esta)



7
00:00:18:19 --> 00:00:22:07
 from your imagination into a form that can be shared

8
00:00:24:11 --> 00:00:27:27
It could be a simple Processing sketch

9
00:00:29:01 --> 00:00:33:25
or an application that takes you longer to make in openFrameworks

10
00:00:34:02 --> 00:00:39:08
But in the end you have something tangible to show

11
00:00:39:15 --> 00:00:45:08
Something that talks about a process or about an idea that starts

12
00:00:45:11 --> 00:00:49:13
to develop from nowhere, an algorithm, a pattern that repeats, 

13
00:00:49:16 --> 00:00:52:07
something that has motion
