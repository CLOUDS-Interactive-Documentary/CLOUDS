Obviously, partners always hate computers, right?! So I have a big thing with my wife, where 

2
00:00:06:18 --> 00:00:08:29
‘you’re always on your computer! What are you doing, why are you always on your computer?!’

00:00:09:02 --> 00:00:15:02
And it’s like, it’s not a computer, it’s a window into this other universe,

00:00:15:05 --> 00:00:18:06
where, in that other universe, I am God!
