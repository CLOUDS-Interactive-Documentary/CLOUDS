00:00:01:01 --> 00:00:05:20
One of the things that I like about our current era is that

2
00:00:05:23 --> 00:00:09:08
statistics is becoming something that everyone is starting to think about.

3
00:00:09:11 --> 00:00:13:25
There is this famous quote that statisticians repeat endlessly from Hal Varian 

4
00:00:13:28 --> 00:00:16:13
about statistics being the next sexy profession,

5
00:00:16:16 --> 00:00:19:28
and I think that it’s funny because it’s true,

6
00:00:20:01 --> 00:00:23:09
because it is suddenly really glamorous for people.

7
00:00:23:12 --> 00:00:27:00
They call themselves data scientists and I think that’s really good.

8
00:00:27:03 --> 00:00:32:08
I think the more that it becomes a part of the culture, the more that we will all as citizens

9
00:00:32:11 --> 00:00:35:10
be able to make the informed decisions.

10
00:00:35:13 --> 00:00:39:15
The more that people understand the difference between a median and a mean,

11
00:00:39:19 --> 00:00:43:09
the better equipped we are to think about issues like income inquality【inequality】

12
00:00:43:12 --> 00:00:49:02
and so to me I think to the extent that visualization can serve as kind of a gateway drug

13
00:00:49:05 --> 00:00:53:21
 to statistics and can interest people in thinking quantitatively and statistically,

14
00:00:53:24 --> 00:00:57:17
I think it’s serving this higher purpose for a citizenship.
