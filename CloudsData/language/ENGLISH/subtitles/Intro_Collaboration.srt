1
00:00:00:00 --> 00:00:05:00
All of us are based in different
places, different countries

2
00:00:05:00 --> 00:00:10:00
So most of the work, we all upload to GitHub or something similar

3
00:00:10:00 --> 00:00:12:00
So everyone has access to 
the code we’re working on

4
00:00:12:00 --> 00:00:18:00
New work requires new tools, those new tools 
then go back into the toolset and

5
00:00:18:00 --> 00:00:24:00
and then the next person doesn’t have to think 
about that stuff they can think about the next problem

6
00:00:24:00 --> 00:00:31:00
I think the nature of this work because it is so 
technically complex, it has to be collaborative

7
00:00:31:00 --> 00:00:38:00
In a way, the most valuable thing the computer 
has done is to network human intelligence 

8
00:00:38:00 --> 00:00:42:00
we are all getting smarter through each other
