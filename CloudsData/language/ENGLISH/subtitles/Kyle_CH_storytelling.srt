1
00:00:01:02 --> 00:00:02:20
To take

2
00:00:03:11 --> 00:00:09:04
literal spoken language or written language and use things to alter in such a way that it

3
00:00:09:17 --> 00:00:11:28
 becomes something completely different.

4
00:00:12:06 --> 00:00:15:09
Words could spout other words, 

5
00:00:15:12 --> 00:00:18:25
adjectives spout all of their synonyms, 

6
00:00:18:29 --> 00:00:24:22
 a story can tell itself over and over and over again in perfectly literate, 

7
00:00:24:25 --> 00:00:28:02
perfectly beautiful prose and never repeat itself. 

8
00:00:30:10 --> 00:00:35:06
(You know, I would like to)My world of code would be that kind of 

9
00:00:35:10 --> 00:00:40:00
 space of never-ending, never-repeating stories and 

10
00:00:41:17 --> 00:00:46:03
narratives that would go on

11
00:00:46:06 --> 00:00:51:08
forever and perpetuate themselves and characters that would constantly reinvent themselves in

12
00:00:51:11 --> 00:00:56:20
 ways that we are familiar with from our lives from the people who grow around us and 

13
00:00:57:22 --> 00:01:00:03
who we never wholly understand 

14
00:01:00:27 --> 00:01:04:05
to mirror that in code and words is 

15
00:01:04:08 --> 00:01:06:23
I think that would be really a beautiful thing.
