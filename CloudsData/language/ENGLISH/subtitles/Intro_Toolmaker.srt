00:00:00:00 --> 00:00:05:00
I guess at the moment a lot of what I do is starting as a
toolmaker and moving towards creative work

2
00:00:05:00 --> 00:00:09:00
and trying to change people’s thought process and
imagination through an experience

3
00:00:09:00 --> 00:00:14:00
my entry into creative coding was from a more
traditional computer science background

4
00:00:14:00 --> 00:00:17:00
and then also an art background,
and meeting in the middle

5
00:00:17:00 --> 00:00:22:00
and also seeing the use of creating languages
specifically for this intersection

6
00:00:22:00 --> 00:00:31:00
I think a lot of times people doing this work are
more like crazy researchers slash inventors,

7
00:00:31:00 --> 00:00:37:00
it’s sort of prototyping and sort of research
and development for the future 

8
00:00:37:00 --> 00:00:41:00
so we’re creating the future we
would want to experience
