Pure math starts to almost 

3
00:00:04:03 --> 00:00:07:17
sort of overlap with what I think of as philosophy. 

4
00:00:07:20 --> 00:00:10:21
Mathematicians would be angry that I am saying this maybe, 

5
00:00:12:02 --> 00:00:16:04
 and it’s just sort of like how far can we take these rules that 

6
00:00:16:07 --> 00:00:20:01
we have made, how far can we move

7
00:00:20:18 --> 00:00:25:06
 in these very abstract directions, and then often those abstract directions 

8
00:00:25:09 --> 00:00:28:24
will circle back and relate you to real world, 

9
00:00:28:27 --> 00:00:32:21
which is uncanny, and I like that uncanniness, I think
