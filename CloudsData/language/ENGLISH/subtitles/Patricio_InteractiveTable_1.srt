00:00:00:27 --> 00:00:04:03
I was doing research for 'interactivos' 

3
00:00:04:06 --> 00:00:08:27
one of my first projects was called 'communitas', a circular multitouch table

4
00:00:09:06 --> 00:00:15:00
So I spent time watching videos of how people interacted 

5
00:00:15:03 --> 00:00:16:25
with tactile surfaces

6
00:00:17:00 --> 00:00:21:13
and a recurring image was of people 

7
00:00:21:16 --> 00:00:25:09
being drawn to the tactile table,

8
00:00:25:21 --> 00:00:29:20
and moving things around to try out the system 

9
00:00:30:00 --> 00:00:35:26
with some confusion about how it works

10
00:00:36:14 --> 00:00:39:15
and not really 

11
00:00:40:07 --> 00:00:42:04
interacting with others.
