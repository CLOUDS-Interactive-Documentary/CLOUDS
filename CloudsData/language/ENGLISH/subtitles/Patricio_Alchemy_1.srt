0 --> 213
Since Alchemy, all languages have this property of making things concrete

2
214 --> 408
The privilege of our era is that we can see this process with some immediacy


3
409 --> 490
from having an idea to embodying it in something

4
491 --> 726
This idea from alchemy of having a set of symbols that speak of a process

5
727 --> 789
that's metaphysical and spiritual

6
790 --> 913
that leads you somewhere with a lot of abstraction on the way and

7
914 --> 1061
that ends up being an artistic, spiritual, religious discipline

8
1062 --> 1184
in our times it becomes a reality.

9
1185 --> 1257
especially now that we have 3D printers.

10
1257 --> 1350
so reality the step between complete abstraction

11
1400 --> 1471
- that is code

12
1472 --> 1550
into something physical and real is so short

13
1603 --> 1646
that's amazing.
