00:00:01:02 --> 00:00:03:25
He didn’t know if infinite behavior was  possible.  

3
00:00:04:05 --> 00:00:07:02
He thought here is this thing, he  put out this challenge like 

4
00:00:07:05 --> 00:00:10:06
design and initial  configuration that iterates infinitely 

5
00:00:10:16 --> 00:00:16:25
and  given those rules, there is nothing that said  that should be possible or what that should  look like, 

6
00:00:16:28 --> 00:00:20:17
so through trial and error what’s  called the glider was invented 

7
00:00:20:20 --> 00:00:25:11
and the glider  was a particular shape that moves through  iterations in such a way, 

8
00:00:25:14 --> 00:00:29:14
Conway’s Game of  Life runs that algorithm over the universe  over and over and over again 

9
00:00:30:03 --> 00:00:33:05
and it moves in  such a way that it moves through space 

10
00:00:33:10 --> 00:00:36:03
and it  repeats infinitely. 

11
00:00:36:18 --> 00:00:41:00
So, from a finite initial  state and a finite set of 

12
00:00:41:03 --> 00:00:43:23
almost trivial rules  you can get infinite behavior.
