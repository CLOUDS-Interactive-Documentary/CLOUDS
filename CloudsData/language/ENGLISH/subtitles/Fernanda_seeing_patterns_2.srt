2
00:00:01:06 --> 00:00:05:18
Where you can look at a picture and immediately you understand

3
00:00:05:21 --> 00:00:08:22
what’s background and what’s foreground, what jumps at you.

4
00:00:09:10 --> 00:00:12:06
That’s very complex.

5
00:00:12:09 --> 00:00:16:21
It doesn’t sound complex, but it’s not trivial and we do it immediately,

6
00:00:16:24 --> 00:00:24:01
so one of the things that we get with data visualization is that we are able to show highly complex data 

7
00:00:24:04 --> 00:00:29:00
in ways that look almost natural or intuitive

8
00:00:29:10 --> 00:00:34:07
 in a sense we are sort of playing these tricks with our brain.

9
00:00:34:10 --> 00:00:38:15
We are just sort of speaking the language of the brain in a sense.
