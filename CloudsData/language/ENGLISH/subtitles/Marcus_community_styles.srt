What I always found interesting is that over time when you follow that community

3
00:00:06:23 --> 00:00:11:05
whatever it is really,  you see the characteristics of everyone

4
00:00:11:08 --> 00:00:14:03
kind of coming through more and more

5
00:00:14:06 --> 00:00:17:27
through the different pieces he makes and contributes and shows and

6
00:00:18:00 --> 00:00:20:04
and then you learn more about

7
00:00:20:25 --> 00:00:24:14
the personality or what’s driving that person

8
00:00:24:17 --> 00:00:29:16
and I think 

it’s just socially almost or on this

9
00:00:29:27 --> 00:00:33:21
online social level, it’s nice to get to know people and what really drives them

10
00:00:33:24 --> 00:00:37:23
and to kind of see that as a longer relationship.
