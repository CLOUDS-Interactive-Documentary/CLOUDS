00:00:00:29 --> 00:00:06:12
My ideal vision of the future is not one where  we have surrendered everything to algorithms,  right? 

2
00:00:07:23 --> 00:00:12:15
It’s one where we develop a healthy  relationship with computation and code 

3
00:00:12:18 --> 00:00:17:06
in a  way that can make our lives better, 

4
00:00:17:14 --> 00:00:20:24
but not  one where we blindly surrender everything to  code: 

5
00:00:20:27 --> 00:00:25:25
Code that is obfuscated, proprietary,  and run by corporations.
