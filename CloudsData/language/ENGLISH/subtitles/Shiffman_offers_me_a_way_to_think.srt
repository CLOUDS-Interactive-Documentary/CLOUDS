00:00:00:00 --> 00:00:03:09
…what a computer offers me is a chance to be creative

2
00:00:03:12 --> 00:00:07:28
 in an way that I don’t think that I normally am in everyday life.  I am much too afraid, 

3
00:00:08:01 --> 00:00:12:23
you know, also at the same time that I took this intro to programming  class, 

4
00:00:12:26 --> 00:00:17:16
I took a physical computing class to learn about building things in electronics and circuits and

5
00:00:17:19 --> 00:00:20:08
it just didn’t work for me.  I was

6
00:00:20:14 --> 00:00:25:00
burning my fingers or setting things on fire and falling apart.  

7
00:00:25:03 --> 00:00:31:18
The way that you think about software, the logical steps, 
the way that you think about pixels,

8
00:00:32:11 --> 00:00:35:13
 it fits with a way that I like to think

9
00:00:35:16 --> 00:00:39:29
and to me that offered a chance to be creative where I wouldn’t necessarily have done without them.
