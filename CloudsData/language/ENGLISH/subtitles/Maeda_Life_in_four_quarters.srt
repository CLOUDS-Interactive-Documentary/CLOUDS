00:00:00:00 --> 00:00:04:16
Oh, yeah, no, I have been lucky to have [Unclear] mentors;

3
00:00:05:02 --> 00:00:09:27
 one important one is Mits Kataoka [ph].  He is a UCLA Professor Emeritus, 

4
00:00:10:00 --> 00:00:12:21
and he once said to me how 

5
00:00:13:13 --> 00:00:16:03
John, life is lived in four quarters, 

6
00:00:16:22 --> 00:00:18:20
0-25 years of age, 

7
00:00:18:23 --> 00:00:22:21
25-50, 50-75, 75-100, and

8
00:00:23:00 --> 00:00:27:06
 he said John, don’t forget that most people don’t make it to the fourth quarter,

9
00:00:28:22 --> 00:00:33:27
and third quarter is pretty hard because your body begins to really decay. 

10
00:00:34:20 --> 00:00:38:21
 You are in your second quarter, make a difference in your second quarter, 

11
00:00:38:27 --> 00:00:41:05
so yes, I think about that a lot like how much

12
00:00:41:08 --> 00:00:45:25
time do I have to make a difference in this second quarter.  

13
00:00:47:00 --> 00:00:48:11
It’s precious to me.
