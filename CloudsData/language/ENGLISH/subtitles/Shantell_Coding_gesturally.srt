In the future, maybe coding will become more gestural.

00:00:04:00 --> 00:00:10:10
 Now is, you sit down and you do this, and then there is a result and you do this and then there is a result.

00:00:10:16 --> 00:00:13:20

00:00:13:23 --> 00:00:19:09
  Why can’t we use our body to create code and then create a result or an effect,

00:00:19:12 --> 00:00:22:08
and when that happens, I will happily be coding.
