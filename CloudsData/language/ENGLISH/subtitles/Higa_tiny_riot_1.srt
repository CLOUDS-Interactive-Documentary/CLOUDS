00:00:01.9 - 00:00:06.1
When we made the Tiny Riot,  

2
00:00:06.1 - 00:00:13.8
Kensuke Sembo, and a sound artist who is a friend of mine, Taeji Sawai  

3
00:00:13.8 - 00:00:19.0
they met, really clicked, and started the project.   

4
00:00:19.0 - 00:00:25.3
Perhaps, when they got together for a drink, they hit it off well, and  

5
00:00:25.3 - 00:00:28.3
they called me up in the middle of the night 

6
00:00:28.3 - 00:00:33.2
and urged me to join them to make it happen, something like that  

7
00:00:33.2 - 00:00:38.2
So, they got me join in the project...
