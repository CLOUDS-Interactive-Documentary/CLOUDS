00:00:00:12 --> 00:00:03:17
Sure, so there are couple of boundary conditions with visualization.

3
00:00:03:20 --> 00:00:06:08
One of them is just the number of pixels on the screen

4
00:00:06:11 --> 00:00:10:24
like just to get round numbers, let’s say, we have a 1000 pixels by 1000 pixels,

5
00:00:10:27 --> 00:00:15:00
each one of those pixels has maybe 24 bits of color that you can see

6
00:00:15:03 --> 00:00:19:06
and for a static image if you think about it, that’s not that much,

7
00:00:19:09 --> 00:00:22:07
that is maybe 3 megabytes of information, right,

8
00:00:22:10 --> 00:00:25:28
and many, many databases are gigabytes.

9
00:00:26:01 --> 00:00:29:13
Now, we can get around that in a couple of ways.  You can animate,

10
00:00:29:16 --> 00:00:34:02
so you can show things moving and that gives you more information over time,

11
00:00:34:05 --> 00:00:38:05
but even then you really start to think about, okay, what can your eye perceive

12
00:00:38:08 --> 00:00:41:28
and if you start to think about the bandwidth of your eye, it’s not just that high

13
00:00:42:01 --> 00:00:45:28
and it’s not really absorbing that much from movement.

14
00:00:46:01 --> 00:00:49:29
Another thing you can do is add interaction and that’s really what you have to do

15
00:00:50:02 --> 00:00:55:10
to see large databases at least a part,but in the end, you are never going to see the whole database,

16
00:00:55:13 --> 00:01:00:18
 like there is just not enough bandwidth from the screen to your eyes and

17
00:01:00:21 --> 00:01:04:08
 there is not really enough bandwidth from your eyes to your brain to get gigabytes in,

18
00:01:04:11 --> 00:01:09:00
and probably your brain is not smart enough to think about gigabytes in any fast manner.
