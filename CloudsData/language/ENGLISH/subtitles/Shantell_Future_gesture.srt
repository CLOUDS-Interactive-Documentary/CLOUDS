00:00:01:08 --> 00:00:05:03
If I was to really stretch my imagination and think about technology that 

2
00:00:05:06 --> 00:00:09:18
doesn’t exist today which I would love to perform in the future or love to experience in the future,

3
00:00:09:21 --> 00:00:13:17
 it would have to come back to that gestural experience.  

4
00:00:14:01 --> 00:00:18:17
I would love to be able to perform or see a performance where

5
00:00:18:20 --> 00:00:22:15
 perhaps the audience are collectively a part of it, because

6
00:00:22:18 --> 00:00:26:03
 the audience are expressing themselves in a certain way which is 

7
00:00:26:06 --> 00:00:30:08
fed or input into a device,

8
00:00:30:11 --> 00:00:35:24
 which creates a visual experience and that visual experience doesn’t have to be on something flat. 

9
00:00:35:27 --> 00:00:40:04
 It could be something that exists all around us.  It could be sound, it could be visuals,

10
00:00:40:07 --> 00:00:42:18
 it could be a feeling, it could be a smell.
