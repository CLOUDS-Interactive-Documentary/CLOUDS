1
00:00:01:00 --> 00:00:05:26
 if you look at where we are with our tools that we have available,

2
00:00:06:01 --> 00:00:09:16
we have got the basic needs covered

3
00:00:10:06 --> 00:00:12:11
the basic input, output interactions

4
00:00:12:14 --> 00:00:14:15
the basic input, output interactions rendering, that’s done. 

5
00:00:14:20 --> 00:00:17:27
People don’t predict big advances there.

6
00:00:18:01 --> 00:00:22:02
The limit of our physical senses is kind of

7
00:00:22:07 --> 00:00:27:23
- the limit of where real and virtual kind of overlaps and meets

8
00:00:27:26 --> 00:00:30:15
 - that’s visible, I mean,

9
00:00:30:19 --> 00:00:34:25
Tim Sweeney from Epic Games says that in 2020 basically. 

10
00:00:35:02 --> 00:00:41:07
At that point in time, we will have graphics card produccing
and 3D games engines producing

11
00:00:41:10 --> 00:00:46:10
visuals that can fool our eyes
believably enough,

12
00:00:46:20 --> 00:00:50:08
and so all this extra computation power from then on 

13
00:00:50:13 --> 00:00:55:12
hopefully will be spent on
developing deeper knowledge systems

14
00:00:56:05 --> 00:00:59:21
that can do something like modeling consciousness 

15
00:01:01:01 --> 00:01:04:14
or create more complex, deeper interactions

16
00:01:04:19 --> 00:01:09:04
 and I think that’s where I would love cinema to go to

17
00:01:09:07 --> 00:01:13:20
where we can play with these virtual actors and we can interact with them

18
00:01:13:23 --> 00:01:17:17
on a believable deeper human level.
