00:00:01.1 - 00:00:05.1 
To tell you truth, I initially wanted to make music 

2
00:00:05.1 - 00:00:17.4
To make music, I tried creating my own software, and  

3
00:00:17.4 - 00:00:23.4
thought it would be nice to attach 
synchronized visuals to the sound  

4
00:00:23.4 - 00:00:25.9
So, I added visuals  

5
00:00:25.9 - 00:00:30.6 
Since then, creating visuals has become 
more and more interesting to me

6
00:00:30.6 - 00:00:33.7
and so that's what led me to now, 

7
00:00:33.7 - 00:00:37.1
but it's not as though I chose from many options

8
00:00:37.1 - 00:00:43.2
It came to me rather naturally. 
I have worked on lots of different projects and  

9
00:00:43.2 - 00:00:47.8
somehow ended up going in this direction.
