00:00:01:02 --> 00:00:04:04
…And that’s like sort of like getting the old prize pumpkin.

00:00:04:07 --> 00:00:08:13
It’s like I'm a pretty good pumpkin farmer, and I have good years and I have bad years,

00:00:08:16 --> 00:00:10:26
 but it’s not like I engineer pumpkins.

00:00:10:29 --> 00:00:14:13
 I kind of know where the seed is and I know a few certain

00:00:14:20 --> 00:00:18:06
 pumpkin growin’ tricks, but there is a certain amount of randomness

00:00:18:09 --> 00:00:24:12
