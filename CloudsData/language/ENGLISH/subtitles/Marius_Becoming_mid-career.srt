1
00:00:00:00 --> 00:00:02:07
Actually in the sense of like third-generation shifts, 

2
00:00:02:10 --> 00:00:06:06
there’s now generally a full new generation of people

3
00:00:06:09 --> 00:00:08:20
 making work which is quite different from, for instance, the work that I am doing

4
00:00:08:23 --> 00:00:11:20
or Golan Levin is or Casey Rease has 

5
00:00:11:23 --> 00:00:13:05
and they have different concerns.

6
00:00:13:08 --> 00:00:17:19
At the same time, people like me are passing into a role of being 

7
00:00:17:22 --> 00:00:20:00
what in the art world is called a mid career artists,

8
00:00:20:03 --> 00:00:23:11
which means that your interests are going to change 

9
00:00:23:14 --> 00:00:28:22
and you are also going to start doing projects which deal less with just like putting yourself out there in the world,

10
00:00:28:25 --> 00:00:32:12
but also dealing more with kind of posterity and sort of 

11
00:00:32:15 --> 00:00:36:22
figuring out like, okay, what is it I am really trying to say and saying that in a more mature way.

12
00:00:36:25 --> 00:00:40:01
At the same 
time, I think there’s going to be multiple generation ships【→shifts】

13
00:00:40:04 --> 00:00:44:01
that are happening and to me that’s actually one of the most fantastic things out there

14
00:00:44:04 --> 00:00:47:25
like literally I am looking forward to being surprised completely

15
00:00:47:28 --> 00:00:51:11
by what people are doing with these kind of technologies
