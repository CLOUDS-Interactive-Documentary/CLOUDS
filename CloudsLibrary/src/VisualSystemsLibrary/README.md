#Visual Systems Library

We call VisualSystems to modular visual sketches that reinforce and illustrate abstract concepts present on CLOUDS Documentary.

In order to make the process of making a VisualSystem efficient and easy. We have put together [Reza Ali](http://www.syedrezaali.com) DJ environment call *Rezonator*. This will lets sketch powerful sketches providing the exquisite `ofxUI` to customize every single detail of it. This variables will be able to be save as **Presets**. At the end this Presets are going to be curated inside the documentary.

Together with [James George](http://jamesgeorge.org/)'s `ofxTimeLine` this environment provides the ability to animate those changes over time.
