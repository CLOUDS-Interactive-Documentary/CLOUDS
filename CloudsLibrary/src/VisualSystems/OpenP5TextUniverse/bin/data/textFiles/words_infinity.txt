Words I think are closer to formulas

they're closer to computer code

and I think the magical thing about words is that you can conjure up an infinity of things very easily with words* 

in computer code you can create a loop that does a thousand things at once or a million or a billion*

it's basically the same code 

in a diagram how are you going to diagram a quadrillion things? 

you can't really do it
