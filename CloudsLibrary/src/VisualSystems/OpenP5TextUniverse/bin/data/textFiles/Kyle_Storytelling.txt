I would like to use code to shape language to make a hybrid between language itself and things that alter language

 To take literal spoken language or written language and use things to alter it in such away that it becomes something completely different

Words could spout other words. Adjectives could spout synonyms

 A story can tell itself over and over and over again in perfectly literate perfectly beautiful prose and never repeat itself
 
My world of code would be that kind of space of neverending. never repeating stories Narratives that could never end. Narratives that would go on forever and perpetuate themselves and characters that would reinvent themselves in ways that we're familiar with from our own lives from the people who grow around us who we never wholly understand 

To mirror that in words would be a really beautiful thing.
