I've done a lot of work looking at sentiment analysis and language analysis of speech and text

and it's gotten to the point where you really start to pick out qualities more than positive but negative but how aggressive or how angry or how optimistic is the person sounding 

and I think that will continue to evolve and there are a lot of interesting implications there especially as we start to communicate more and more through written text and less voice

there's possibilities to get feedback on what you're saying or what the other person is saying
and to have this kind of meta-layer of understanding 

which is something we do normally when we have a conversation but it's kind of interesting what happens when that is being made explicit
