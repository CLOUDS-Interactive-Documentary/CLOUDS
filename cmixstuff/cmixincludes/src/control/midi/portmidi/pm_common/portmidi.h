/* CHANGELOG FOR PORTMIDI
 *
 * 25May04 RBD
 *  - removed support for MIDI THRU
 *  - moved filtering from Pm_Read to pm_enqueue to avoid buffer ovfl
 *  - extensive work on Mac OS X port, especially sysex and error handling
 *
 * 18May04 RBD
 *  - removed side-effects from assert() calls. Now you can disable assert().
 *  - no longer check pm_hosterror everywhere, fixing a bug where an open
 *    failure could cause a write not to work on a previously opened port
 *    until you call Pm_GetHostErrorText().
 * 16May04 RBD and Chris Roberts
 *  - Some documentation wordsmithing in portmidi.h
 *  - Dynamically allocate port descriptor structures
 *  - Fixed parameter error in midiInPrepareBuffer and midiInAddBuffer.
 *
 * 09Oct03 RBD
 *  - Changed Thru handling. Now the client does all the work and the client
 *    must poll or read to keep thru messages flowing.
 *
 * 31May03 RBD
 *  - Fixed various bugs.
 *  - Added linux ALSA support with help from Clemens Ladisch
 *  - Added Mac OS X support, implemented by Jon Parise, updated and integrated by
 *     Andrew Zeldis and Zico Kolter
 *  - Added latency program to build histogram of system latency using PortTime.
 *
 * 30Jun02 RBD Extensive rewrite of sysex handling. It works now.
 *             Extensive reworking of error reporting and error text -- no
 *             longer use dictionary call to delete data; instead, Pm_Open
 *             and Pm_Close clean up before returning an error code, and 
 *             error text is saved in a system-independent location.
 *             Wrote sysex.c to test sysex message handling.
 *
 * 15Jun02 BCT changes:
 *  - Added pmHostError text handling.
 *  - For robustness, check PortMidi stream args not NULL.
 *  - Re-C-ANSI-fied code (changed many C++ comments to C style)
 *  - Reorganized code in pmwinmm according to input/output functionality (made
 *    cleanup handling easier to reason about)
 *  - Fixed Pm_Write calls (portmidi.h says these should not return length but Pm_Error)
 *  - Cleaned up memory handling (now system specific data deleted via dictionary
 *    call in PortMidi, allows client to query host errors).
 *  - Added explicit asserts to verify various aspects of pmwinmm implementation behaves as
 *    logic implies it should. Specifically: verified callback routines not reentrant and
 *    all verified status for all unchecked Win32 MMedia API calls perform successfully
 *  - Moved portmidi initialization and clean-up routines into DLL to fix Win32 MMedia API 
 *    bug (i.e. if devices not explicitly closed, must reboot to debug application further).
 *    With this change, clients no longer need explicitly call Pm_Initialize, Pm_Terminate, or
 *    explicitly Pm_Close open devices when using WinMM version of PortMidi.
 *
 * 23Jan02 RBD Fixed bug in pmwinmm.c thru handling
 *
 * 21Jan02 RBD Added tests in Pm_OpenInput() and Pm_OpenOutput() to prevent 
 *               opening an input as output and vice versa.
 *             Added comments and documentation.
 *             Implemented Pm_Terminate().
 *
 *
 * IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT A WIN32 BUG:
 *
 *    Windows apparently has a serious midi bug -- if you do not close ports, Windows
 *    may crash. PortMidi tries to protect against this by using a DLL to clean up.
 *
 *    If client exits for example with:
 *      i)  assert 
 *      ii) Ctrl^c, 
 *    then DLL clean-up routine called. However, when client does something 
 *    really bad (e.g. assigns value to NULL pointer) then DLL CLEANUP ROUTINE
 *    NEVER RUNS! In this state, if you wait around long enough, you will
 *    probably get the blue screen of death. Can also go into Pview and there will
 *    exist zombie process that you can't kill.
 *
 * NOTES ON HOST ERROR REPORTING: 
 *
 *    PortMidi errors (of type PmError) are generic, system-independent errors.
 *    When an error does not map to one of the more specific PmErrors, the
 *    catch-all code pmHostError is returned. This means that PortMidi has
 *    retained a more specific system-dependent error code. The caller can
 *    get more information by calling Pm_HasHostError() to test if there is
 *    a pending host error, and Pm_GetHostErrorText() to get a text string
 *    describing the error. Host errors are reported on a per-device basis 
 *    because only after you open a device does PortMidi have a place to 
 *    record the host error code. I.e. only 
 *    those routines that receive a (PortMidiStream *) argument check and 
 *    report errors. One exception to this is that Pm_OpenInput() and 
 *    Pm_OpenOutput() can report errors even though when an error occurs,
 *    there is no PortMidiStream* to hold the error. Fortunately, both
 *    of these functions return any error immediately, so we do not really
 *    need per-device error memory. Instead, any host error code is stored
 *    in a global, pmHostError is returned, and the user can call 
 *    Pm_GetHostErrorText() to get the error message (and the invalid stream
 *    parameter will be ignored.) The functions 
 *    pm_init and pm_term do not fail or raise
 *    errors. The job of pm_init is to locate all available devices so that
 *    the caller can get information via PmDeviceInfo(). If an error occurs,
 *    the device is simply not listed as available.
 *
 *    Host errors come in two flavors:
 *      a) host error 
 *      b) host error during callback
 *    These can occur w/midi input or output devices. (b) can only happen 
 *    asynchronously (during callback routines), whereas (a) only occurs while
 *    synchronously running PortMidi and any resulting system dependent calls
 *
 *    Host-error reporting relies on following assumptions:
 *      1) PortMidi routines won't allow system dependent routines to be 
 *         called when args are bogus.
 *         Thus, in pmwinmm.c it is safe to assume:
 *          - stream ptr valid 
 *          - currently not operating in "has host error" state 
 *      2) Host-error reporting relies on a staged delivery of error messages.
 *         When a host error occurs, the error code is saved with the stream.
 *         The error is reported as a return code from the next operation on
 *         the stream. This could be immediately if the error is synchronous,
 *         or delayed if the error is an asynchronous callback problem. In
 *         any case, when pmHostError is returned, the error is copied to 
 *         a global, pm_hosterror and the error code stored with the stream
 *         is cleared. If the user chooses to inquire about the error using
 *         Pm_GetHostErrorText(), the error will be reported as text. If the
 *         user ignores the error and makes another call on the stream, the
 *         call will proceed because the error code associated with the stream
 *         has been cleared.

    Pm_GetDefaultInputDeviceID(), Pm_GetDefaultOutputDeviceID()

    Return the default device ID or pmNoDevice if there are no devices.
    The result can be passed to Pm_OpenMidi().
    
    On the PC, the user can specify a default device by
    setting an environment variable. For example, to use device #1.

        set PM_RECOMMENDED_OUTPUT_DEVICE=1
    
    The user should first determine the available device ID by using
    the supplied application "testin" or "testout".

    In general, the registry is a better place for this kind of info,
    and with USB devices that can come and go, using integers is not
    very reliable for device identification. Under Windows, if
    PM_RECOMMENDED_OUTPUT_DEVICE (or PM_RECOMMENDED_INPUT_DEVICE) is
    *NOT* found in the environment, then the default device is obtained
    by looking for a string in the registry under:
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/PortMidi/Recommended_Input_Device
    and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/PortMidi/Recommended_Output_Device
    for a string. The number of the first device with a substring that
    matches the string exactly is returned. For example, if the string
    in the registry is "USB", and device 1 is named 
    "In USB MidiSport 1x1", then that will be the default
    input because it contains the string "USB".

    In addition to the name, PmDeviceInfo has the member "interf", which
    is the interface name. (The "interface" is the underlying software
	system or API used by PortMidi to access devices. Examples are 
	MMSystem, DirectX (not implemented), ALSA, OSS (not implemented), etc.)
	At present, the only Win32 interface is "MMSystem", the only Linux
	interface is "ALSA", and the only Max OS X interface is "CoreMIDI".
    To specify both the interface and the device name in the registry,
    separate the two with a comma and a space, e.g.:
        MMSystem, In USB MidiSport 1x1
    In this case, the string before the comma must be a substring of
    the "interf" string, and the string after the space must be a 
    substring of the "name" name string in order to match the device.

    Note: in the current release, the default is simply the first device
	(the input or output device with the lowest PmDeviceID).

    Pm_OpenInput() and Pm_OpenOutput() open devices.

    stream is the address of a PortMidiStream pointer which will receive
    a pointer to the newly opened stream.

    inputDevice is the id of the device used for input (see PmDeviceID above).

    inputDriverInfo is a pointer to an optional driver specific data structure
    containing additional information for device setup or handle processing.
    inputDriverInfo is never required for correct operation. If not used
    inputDriverInfo should be NULL.

    outputDevice is the id of the device used for output (see PmDeviceID above.)

    outputDriverInfo is a pointer to an optional driver specific data structure
    containing additional information for device setup or handle processing.
    outputDriverInfo is never required for correct operation. If not used
    outputDriverInfo should be NULL.

    For input, the buffersize specifies the number of input events to be 
    buffered waiting to be read using Pm_Read(). For output, buffersize 
    specifies the number of output events to be buffered waiting for output. 
    (In some cases -- see below -- PortMidi does not buffer output at all
	and merely passes data to a lower-level API, in which case buffersize
	is ignored.)
    
    latency is the delay in milliseconds applied to timestamps to determine 
    when the output should actually occur. (If latency is < 0, 0 is assumed.) 
    If latency is zero, timestamps are ignored and all output is delivered
    immediately. If latency is greater than zero, output is delayed until
    the message timestamp plus the latency. In some cases, PortMidi can obtain
	better timing than your application by passing timestamps along to the
	device driver or hardware. Latency may also help you to synchronize midi
	data to audio data by matching midi latency to the audio buffer latency.

    time_proc is a pointer to a procedure that returns time in milliseconds. It
    may be NULL, in which case a default millisecond timebase (PortTime) is 
    used. If the application wants to use PortTime, it should start the timer
    (call Pt_Start) before calling Pm_OpenInput or Pm_OpenOutput. If the
    application tries to start the timer *after* Pm_OpenInput or Pm_OpenOutput,
    it may get a ptAlreadyStarted error from Pt_Start, and the application's
    preferred time resolution and callback function will be ignored.
    time_proc result values are appended to incoming MIDI data, and time_proc
    times are used to schedule outgoing MIDI data (when latency is non-zero).

    time_info is a pointer passed to time_proc. 

    return value:
    Upon success Pm_Open() returns PmNoError and places a pointer to a
    valid PortMidiStream in the stream argument.
    If a call to Pm_Open() fails a nonzero error code is returned (see
    PMError above) and the value of port is invalid.

    Any stream that is successfully opened should eventually be closed

/* All midi data comes in the form of PmEvent structures. A sysex
   message is encoded as a sequence of PmEvent structures, with each
   structure carrying 4 bytes of the message, i.e. only the first
   PmEvent carries the status byte.

   Note that MIDI allows nested messages: the so-called "real-time" MIDI 
   messages can be inserted into the MIDI byte stream at any location, 
   including within a sysex message. MIDI real-time messages are one-byte
   messages used mainly for timing (see the MIDI spec). PortMidi retains 
   the order of non-real-time MIDI messages on both input and output, but 
   it does not specify exactly how real-time messages are processed. This
   is particulary problematic for MIDI input, because the input parser 
   must either prepare to buffer an unlimited number of sysex message 
   bytes or to buffer an unlimited number of real-time messages that 
   arrive embedded in a long sysex message. To simplify things, the input
   parser is allowed to pass real-time MIDI messages embedded within a 
   sysex message, and it is up to the client to detect, process, and 
   remove these messages as they arrive.

   When receiving sysex messages, the sysex message is terminated
   by either an EOX status byte (anywhere in the 4 byte messages) or
   by a non-real-time status byte in the low order byte of the message.
   If you get a non-real-time status byte but there was no EOX byte, it 
   means the sysex message was somehow truncated. This is not
   considered an error; e.g., a missing EOX can result from the user
   disconnecting a MIDI cable during sysex transmission.

   A real-time message can occur within a sysex message. A real-time 
   message will always occupy a full PmEvent with the status byte in 
   the low-order byte of the PmEvent message field. (This implies that
   the byte-order of sysex bytes and real-time message bytes may not
   be preserved -- for example, if a real-time message arrives after
   3 bytes of a sysex message, the real-time message will be delivered
   first. The first word of the sysex message will be delivered only
   after the 4th byte arrives, filling the 4-byte PmEvent message field.
   
   The timestamp field is observed when the output port is opened with
   a non-zero latency. A timestamp of zero means "use the current time",
   which in turn means to deliver the message with a delay of
   latency (the latency parameter used when opening the output port.)
   Do not expect PortMidi to sort data according to timestamps -- 
   messages should be sent in the correct order, and timestamps MUST 
   be non-decreasing.

   A sysex message will generally fill many PmEvent structures. On 
   output to a PortMidiStream with non-zero latency, the first timestamp
   on sysex message data will determine the time to begin sending the 
   message. PortMidi implementations may ignore timestamps for the 
   remainder of the sysex message. 
   
   On input, the timestamp ideally denotes the arrival time of the 
   status byte of the message. The first timestamp on sysex message 
   data will be valid. Subsequent timestamps may denote 
   when message bytes were actually received, or they may be simply 
   copies of the first timestamp.

   Timestamps for nested messages: If a real-time message arrives in 
   the middle of some other message, it is enqueued immediately with 
   the timestamp corresponding to its arrival time. The interrupted 
   non-real-time message or 4-byte packet of sysex data will be enqueued 
   later. The timestamp of interrupted data will be equal to that of
   the interrupting real-time message to insure that timestamps are
   non-decreasing.

    Pm_Read() retrieves midi data into a buffer, and returns the number

    Buffer Overflow

    The problem: if an input overflow occurs, data will be lost, ultimately 
    because there is no flow control all the way back to the data source. 
    When data is lost, the receiver should be notified and some sort of 
    graceful recovery should take place, e.g. you shouldn't resume receiving 
    in the middle of a long sysex message.

    With a lock-free fifo, which is pretty much what we're stuck with to 
    enable portability to the Mac, it's tricky for the producer and consumer 
    to synchronously reset the buffer and resume normal operation.

    Solution: the buffer managed by PortMidi will be flushed when an overflow
    occurs. The consumer (Pm_Read()) gets an error message (pmBufferOverflow)
    and ordinary processing resumes as soon as a new message arrives. The
    remainder of a partial sysex message is not considered to be a "new
    message" and will be flushed as well.
