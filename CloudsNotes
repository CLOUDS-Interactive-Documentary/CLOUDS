NOTES

-- Starting nodes?

	-- Marius Parameter space duplicate

	-- Shantell luck is split up and less to do with sharing 
	
	-- Start/End energy matches!!
	
-- Voice Over rules?

-- Knob for clips in a given topic? currently hardcoded

-- Handling overlapping clips	

-- Supress people that have shown up too much

-- Link suppressor

-- Scarcity // easter eggs

-- Dead ends?

-- Links may switch topis

AMBIGUOUS:
	-- "Control" individual/creative   versus  societal
	-- "Performance" live audiovisual(VJ) versus performance art

-- Played too many times in the last few times suppress the speaker

-- Collaborating weird between Zach (working with golan) & Marcus (audiovisual) clips

ERRORS:
Casey - Casey
Casey - Systems Theory
Kyle - "Transparent Tech" twice
Karolina - "toolmaking" cuts out early
Elliot - "Toolmaker Artist Spectrum is off"
Shiffman - "how far can we get" == voice at the end of it
Nervous Jessica -- Marker 2 is the same as Nervous 
Casey - Group Teaching

need better criteria for "exhausting" a topic, more than number of clips
